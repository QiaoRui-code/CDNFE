Causality-Directed Network Flow Entropy
1.Co-expression Network Construction 
Apply WGCNA to GEM
Generate undirected co-expression network----WGCNA.R
2.Directed Network Construction and filter the centre gene ---filter.m
3. CDNFE Score Calculation ---CDNFE.py

The enrichment analysis of DNBs is based on the Gene Ontology Consortium (http://geneontol-ogy.org), DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) and Circos (http://www.circos.ca/ ). The gene function annotation of each disease was obtained through GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/ ). Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks were drawn using STRING (https://string-db.org/ ) and the client software Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/).
